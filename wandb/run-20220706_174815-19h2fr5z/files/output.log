This behavior will be deprecated in a future release in favor of the SavedModel format. Meanwhile, the HDF5 model is saved as W&B files and the SavedModel as W&B Artifacts.
WARNING:tensorflow:Issue encountered when serializing table_initializer.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef. Note this is a warning and probably safe to ignore.
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'
WARNING:tensorflow:From c:\Users\jPao\anaconda3\envs\tf-py39\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\profiler\internal\flops_registry.py:138: tensor_shape_from_node_def_name (from tensorflow.python.framework.graph_util_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.compat.v1.graph_util.tensor_shape_from_node_def_name`
